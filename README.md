# üí§ Driver Drowsiness Detection System

A real-time computer vision system that detects driver fatigue by monitoring eye closure and yawning using webcam input. The system leverages deep learning models to trigger alerts and log drowsiness events, helping reduce road accidents.

## üîç Overview

This project implements a **real-time driver drowsiness detection system** using:

- ‚úÖ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for eye and yawn state classification  
- ‚úÖ Mediapipe FaceMesh for accurate facial landmark detection  
- ‚úÖ Streamlit interface for interactive user control and visualization

The system analyzes live webcam feed to identify fatigue signs such as prolonged eye closure and frequent yawning. Alerts are triggered and screenshots/logs are saved when drowsiness is detected.

## üìå Features

- üß† Real-time eye and yawn detection using custom CNN models  
- üéØ FaceMesh landmark tracking to extract eyes and mouth regions  
- üïí Frame-based alert logic with counters to reduce false positives  
- üíæ Automatic screenshot saving and log entry when drowsiness is detected  
- üåê Streamlit web app with Start/Stop controls and log download

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Webcam-enabled environment

### üîß Setup Instructions

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/driver_drowsiness_System.git
cd driver_drowsiness_System

# 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```
## üß† How It Works

### üîπ Face Detection & ROI Extraction
Mediapipe detects facial landmarks and crops regions for both eyes and the mouth.

### üîπ CNN-Based Classification
- Eye model predicts **Open** or **Closed** from cropped eye images  
- Yawn model predicts **Yawn** or **No Yawn** from mouth region

### üîπ Alert Logic
If eyes remain closed for **‚â• 15 frames** or yawns are detected in **‚â• 2 frames**, the system:
- Saves the current frame as a screenshot  
- Logs the event with a timestamp and reason  
- Displays an alert message in the UI

### üîπ User Interface
- Start/Stop webcam detection  
- Live counter updates for eyes/yawn  
- CSV log download from sidebar
